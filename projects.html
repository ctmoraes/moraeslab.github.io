          <h2>Manipulating mtDNA heteroplasmy</h2>
          <p>
            When mutant mtDNA is heteroplastic (i.e. co-exists with wild-type mtDNA),
            the ability to destroy the mutant genomes can increase the levels of wild-type
            mtDNA. We have developed a series of mtDNA editing enzymes designed to promote
            a double-strand break in the mtDNA. Once mtDNA is cleaved, it is rapidly
            degraded, leading to a transient depletion of mtDNA levels. The residual
            molecules (now with increased relative levels of wild-type mtDNA) repopulate
            mitochondria to normalize mtDNA levels. Recently, we have used mitoTALENs as
            tools to reduce levels of mutant mtDNA in defective cells and tissues
            (Pereira et al., 2018; Bacman et al., 2018).

          <h2>mtDNA mutations in aging</h2>
          <p>
            As we age, small levels of mtDNA deletions accumulate in our cells,
            particularly in neurons and muscle. We have developed mouse models in which
            we can induce mtDNA damage in different tissues. These mice have been
            instrumental to analyze the role of mtDNA damage in the aging of skeletal
            muscle and neurons. In addition, we have studied how transcriptional
            regulators can compensate for age-related changes in gene expression
            (Garcia et al., 2018).

          <h2>Understanding genotype–phenotype correlations in mitochondrial diseases</h2>
          <p>
            Mitochondrial diseases have heterogeneous clinical presentations. The causes
            of these phenotypes are poorly understood, and we have developed several
            models with defects in different mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
            enzymes to address this question, particularly for defects in the Central
            Nervous System. One such model is a mouse with defective cytochrome c in
            neurons, which showed a distinct phenotype (Pinto et al., 2018).

          <h2>Molecular function of mitochondrial proteins</h2>
          <p>
            We also study the basic function of mitochondrial proteins that modulate the
            energy-producing oxidative phosphorylation system (Arguello et al., 2018).
            These include subunits of the OXPHOS complexes as well as proteins that
            indirectly affect mitochondrial function. We recently found that ATAD3
            controls mitochondrial cristae structure and that loss of this protein
            destabilizes mitochondrial nucleoids, leading to mtDNA damage
            (Peralta et al., 2018).
